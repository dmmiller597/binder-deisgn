# Protein Design Competition

In this competition, you can test your skills as a protein designer by designing a binding protein to the extracellular domain of EGFR, a cancer-associated drug target. The best designs will be experimentally validated in our automated wet lab and all results will be open-sourced.

Target 
---
EGFR

Organism HUMAN

Accession ID P00533


Submission process
---
Every protein designer can submit up to 10 designs.

Designs must adhere to the following criteria:

• Only natural amino acids

• Max 200 amino acids in length

• Single chain

• At least 10 amino acid edit distance from known binders

Evaluation criteria
---
Designs will be ranked based on PAE_interaction with AF2 as described here.

The top 100 designs will be selected for experimental testing.

Additional designs will be chosen for their novelty, creativity in the design process or other interesting factors.

Top 5 designers with the best binding affinity (= lowest KD value) will be awarded with a prize.
