# Protein Design Competition: EGFR Binding Protein

## Overview

This competition challenges protein designers to create a novel binding protein targeting the extracellular domain of EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), a significant cancer-associated drug target. The most promising designs will undergo experimental validation in our state-of-the-art automated wet lab, with all results being open-sourced to benefit the scientific community.

## Target Specifications

- **Protein**: EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)
- **Organism**: Human
- **UniProt Accession ID**: P00533

## Submission Guidelines

Each participant may submit up to 10 unique designs adhering to the following criteria:

1. Utilize only natural amino acids
2. Maximum length of 200 amino acids
3. Single-chain design
4. Maintain at least 10 amino acid edit distance from known EGFR binders

## Evaluation Process

1. Initial ranking based on PAE_interaction scores using AlphaFold2 (AF2)
2. Top 100 designs selected for experimental testing.
3. Additional designs may be chosen based on novelty, creative design approach, or other noteworthy factors.
4. The top 5 designers achieving the best binding affinity (lowest KD value) will receive awards.

## To-Do List

1. [ ] Review current literature on EGFR binding proteins and inhibitors
2. [ ] Set up computational environment with necessary tools (e.g., AlphaFold2, RoseTTAFold)
3. [ ] Develop initial protein design strategy
4. [ ] Generate and optimize protein designs
5. [ ] Perform in silico validation of designs (structure prediction, docking simulations)
6. [ ] Analyze results and iterate on designs
7. [ ] Select top designs for submission
8. [ ] Prepare submission materials according to guidelines
9. [ ] Submit designs before the deadline (TBA)
10. [ ] Document design process for potential follow-up questions
